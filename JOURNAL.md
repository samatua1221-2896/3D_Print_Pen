# June 18, 2025 (7 hours)

Today I decided I wanted to try and make a custom 3D printing pen that's pretty simple in terms of its ability but also has basic functionality. (I also really want some type of 3D printing tool like a 3D printer from highway maybe...) I started to base the concept off of MYNT3D's pen, it took me a little while but I was actually able to break it apart and figure out how the entire thing worked.

Based on the pictures below, I figured out that the pen had a potentiometer to adjust the temperature settings, there were two buttons to control the extruding and retraction of the filament, there was a slider to adjust the speed, and a small DC motor to actually control the movement of the filament. I decided I wanted to basically keep the basic functionality of the MYNT3D pen but have my own spin on it. I did want the entire thing to be powered by a 12V barrel jack to keep it simple. The microcontoller that was inside of the MYNT pen looked to be some type of custom made object, so I decided to use an Arduino Nano to keep it pretty simple for me so far.
