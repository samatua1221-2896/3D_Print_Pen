Today I decided I wanted to try and make a custom 3D printing pen that's pretty simple in terms of its ability but also has basic functionality. (I also really want some type of 3D printing tool like a 3D printer from highway maybe...) I started to base the concept off of MYNT3D's pen, it took me a little while but I was actually able to break it apart and figure out how the entire thing worked.

Based on the pictures below, I figured out that the pen had a potentiometer to adjust the temperature settings, there were two buttons to control the extruding and retraction of the filament, there was a slider to adjust the speed, and a small DC motor to actually control the movement of the filament. I decided I wanted to basically keep the basic functionality of the MYNT3D pen but have my own spin on it. I did want the entire thing to be powered by a 12V barrel jack to keep it simple. The microcontroller that was inside the MYNT pen looked to be some type of custom-made object, so I decided to use an Arduino Nano to keep it pretty simple for me so far.

So far I've been working on the schematic that I can use, I eventually settled on keeping the manual potentiometer instead of a LCD screen, aside from that, I've just been working to keep the whole thing pretty simple and not too complex in its parts, also using THT components cause I've never had experience working with surface mounted components. Below is the main schematic that I have so far for it.

Tomorrow I'll work on arranging the PCB and starting to work on the CAD and wiring structure for the pen.

Today I worked on getting my BOM in order and finishing up the design of my PCB. So far, it's looking like theres not too much to do. I did start working on my BOM and figuring out how to get the products, I started using AliExpress and was extrememly happy to find that almost everything I needed was super cheap and not a problem to find at all. Then I went to go check out and found that none of them ship to Hawaii (:( whyyyy tarrifs) so it looks like I'm going to be searching on Amazon for the best prices again even if that means a little bit of a cost raise. 

Aside from that, now it looks like I've finished my PCB and it's not looking to bad if I say so myself. The pieces are relatively simple to fix and put on so I think it's looking pretty good so far.
