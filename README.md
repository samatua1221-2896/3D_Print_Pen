# 3D_Print_Pen

This is a fully custom 3D print pen that is able to use standard 1.75 filament and work with temperatures of 130°C to 240°C

## Features

- Uses an Arduino Nano to control heating and motor functions
- Temperature dial lets you adjust the nozzle from 130 °C to 240 °C
- PID-controlled heater ensures smooth, stable temperature during use
- 12V 40W MK8-style heater cartridge melts standard 1.75 mm filament
- Compact custom PCB designed in KiCad
- Extrude button: hold to feed, double-tap for continuous release, tap again to stop
- Retract button: same controls in reverse for removing filament
- Motor direction and latching fully handled in firmware with debounce and timing
- Heater auto-shuts off if temp exceeds 260 °C or if thermistor fails
- Failsafe defaults ensure motor and heater are off on startup or error

## Details

This was pretty much my first full dive into a full blast of hardware and software combined in my own project that I'm making from scratch. I got inspiration from the MYNT3D style pen that I had but had been dealt some damage with wear and tear over the years so I decided to try and make my own. Overall, this was a pretty fun project where I was able to get a much better understand of KiCad and Onshape which is definitely going to help me for future projects that I'll be working on. A 3D print pen is also pretty close to a 3D printer that I'm hoping to get but if all else fails I'll have a pretty cool piece of hardware that I'll know I completely designed from scratch.
